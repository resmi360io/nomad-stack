# Corridor fact-checking pipeline

Corridor pages carry fee, tax, and regulator claims that go stale fast. A scheduled
job re-checks every live corridor on a recurring cadence. The pipeline is three
stages and runs without human approval:

1. **Research.** One `corridor-verifier` agent per live corridor, in parallel, in
   research mode. Each returns a change list of anything outdated, incorrect, or
   unverifiable, with primary sources.
2. **Review.** For each corridor with a non-empty change list, one
   `corridor-reviewer` agent independently re-researches every proposed change and
   returns approve / amend / reject per item, plus anything the verifier missed.
   The reviewer writes the final text. It also sets `safe_to_apply`.
3. **Apply.** Approved and amended items are written to `data/corridors.ts` and
   `data/providers.ts`, dates are bumped, the data files are typechecked, and the
   orchestrating session makes a single commit and pushes. One commit per run, so
   concurrent agents never race on the branch.

## Verification rotation

Every live corridor is re-checked once a week. The scheduled job runs daily and
verifies only the corridors assigned to that weekday, by this rule:

  the corridor at index i in CORRIDORS is verified on weekday (i mod 7),
  counting Monday as 0.

That self-balances as corridors are added, with no schedule edit needed. With 8
corridors Monday takes 2 and every other day takes 1. With 42 it is 6 a day.
With 100 it is 15, 15, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14. Adding a corridor to the end of the
file slots it into the lightest day automatically.

Two consequences worth knowing. Index is file order, so reordering CORRIDORS
reshuffles the rotation, which is harmless but will make a corridor skip or
repeat a week. And a corridor added today is not checked until its weekday comes
round, so a newly published page can go up to six days before its first pass.
Verify a new page by hand on the day it ships rather than waiting for the job.

Rules that hold regardless of what a scheduled prompt says:

- A change ships only if a reviewer approved or amended it. Verifier output alone
  never reaches a live page.
- If a reviewer returns `safe_to_apply: false`, that corridor is left alone and the
  reason is reported. Ranking-moving fee changes and unconfirmable tax or
  regulatory claims fall in this bucket.
- Prose and page copy never contain em dash characters. Use periods, commas,
  parentheses, or regular hyphens.
- Anything not confirmable from a primary source is hedged in the copy ("verify
  current"), never stated as a bare number.
- Page copy and the calculator fee model must agree. If a fee changes in one, change
  the other in the same commit.

Verification is not a substitute for shipping the corrections. A run that produces
findings and leaves them unapplied has done nothing for the reader.
